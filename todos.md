<!-- TODO : Mobile Nav breaks @1201px exactly , check the media queries and debug the error -->
<!-- !* : Reason why create an account now stays after resizing is because setHamburger is not set to false when resizing as well as CSS media queries just hide the mobile nav bar completely... One possible solution is to use an hook to watch for window resize and if the window size is above 1200px then automatically set showHamburger as false. This bug occurs only when the mobilenav is open n concurrently resized to desktop version -->
